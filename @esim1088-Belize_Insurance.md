Our mobile and data plans are designed with convenience in mind.

That's why we offer flexible options that cater to every lifestyle. From prepaid SIM cards to postpaid plans, Belize Insurance has something for everyone.

For those who love the freedom of having a phone number without committing to a long-term contract, our eSIMs are a game-changer. The **eSIM** (Embedded Subscriber Identity Module) allows you to activate a virtual SIM card directly onto your compatible smartphone or tablet. This means no more physical SIM cards to swap outâ€”just scan a QR code and you're ready to go! Our eSIMs are perfect for international travelers, frequent flyers, or anyone who juggles multiple devices. You can easily switch between different networks and countries without hassle. Plus, our **eSIM1088** service ensures seamless connectivity across borders, making it an ideal choice for globetrotters.

If you prefer physical SIM cards, Belize Insurance offers both **prepaid** and **postpaid** options. Prepaid SIM cards are great for budget-conscious users who want to control their spending. Simply top up as needed, and enjoy affordable rates for calls, texts, and data. On the other hand, our postpaid plans provide more flexibility and features, such as unlimited data or extended international calling. Whether you're a student, a freelancer, or a family, we have a plan that fits your lifestyle.

In addition to mobile services, Belize Insurance also provides high-speed **data-only SIM cards** for tablets, MiFis, and IoT devices. These cards are perfect for businesses or individuals who need reliable internet access without a phone line. Our data packages are competitively priced and come with generous data allowances, ensuring you stay productive and entertained wherever you are.
