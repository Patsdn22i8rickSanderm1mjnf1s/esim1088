Plus, with an eSIM, you don't have to worry about cutting or damaging your SIM slot, as it's all done digitally.

Whether you opt for a physical SIM card or an eSIM, both offer reliable connectivity at competitive prices. You can choose between pay-as-you-go plans or subscription-based options, depending on how long you plan to stay and how much data you need. Many providers also offer special deals for tourists, so it's worth doing some research before you arrive.
